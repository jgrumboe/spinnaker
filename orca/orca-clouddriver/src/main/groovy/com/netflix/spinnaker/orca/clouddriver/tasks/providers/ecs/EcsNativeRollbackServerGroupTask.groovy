/**
 * Rolls an {@code ecs-native} server group back to an earlier task-definition revision.
 *
 * <p>The classic ECS rollback (see {@code ExplicitRollback}) re-enables a disabled versioned
 * server group and disables the current one -- a model that only works when a deploy produces a new
 * versioned service each time. An {@code ecs-native} service is a single durable service, so
 * "rolling back" instead means pointing that service at an earlier task-definition revision of the
 * same family. That is exactly what the native in-place update does, so this task submits the same
 * {@code updateLaunchConfig} operation the {@code ecs-native} provider already routes to its native
 * {@code UpdateService} converter, with the chosen {@code taskDefinition} and a forced new
 * deployment.
 *
 * <p>Reuses {@link AbstractServerGroupTask}: the {@code cloudProvider} ({@code ecs-native}) on the
 * stage context routes the operation to the {@code @EcsNativeOperation} converter, and the base
 * task publishes {@code deploy.server.groups} so a following {@code waitForEcsNativeServiceDeployment}
 * stage can gate on ECS's rollout state.
